<h3 class="section-header">Parameter Injection</h3>
<div class="section-content">
    <p>The Dinoloop team created a value injection framework which automatically parses the variable segments from the URI and
        injects them as action method parameters. This reduces boiler plate code. This is how it works,
    </p>
    <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
        <pre [innerHTML]="paramEx"></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        ValueInjection framework uses
        <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp">path-to-regexp</a> which is created by expressjs team and it is extensively used in expressjs for routing. Please
        go through their
        <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp">documentation</a> on how to use variable-segments, optional-segments and etc. Following are the assumptions made
        by ValueInjection framework.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Variable segment key should match with action method parameter.</li>
        <li>Currently, all values are injected as
            <i>string</i> type. This is the limitation of variable segments itself.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h5 class="section-header">Using @Parse in ParameterInjection (V2.x.x and above)</h5>
<div class="section-content">
    <p>@Parse does the validation/transformation on the variable segments using IParseHandler (which is simply a mapper function).
        This reduces writing boilerplate code for validation and also seperates the concerns from controllers logic.
    </p>
    <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
        <pre [innerHTML]="parseEx"></pre>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>@Parse can also be used with http-body for model validation.
            <a routerLink="/docs/builtin/model-validations">Here is an example</a> that explains it.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h5 class="section-header">Using @QueryParam in ParameterInjection (V2.x.x and above)</h5>
<div class="section-content">
    <p>@QueryParam does the validation/transformation on the
        <i>query-string/query-params</i> using IParseHandler (which is simply a mapper function). This reduces writing boilerplate
        code for validation and also seperates the concerns from controllers logic.
    </p>
    <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
        <pre [innerHTML]="queryParamEx"></pre>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>@QueryParam works only with query-string values.</li>
    </ul>
