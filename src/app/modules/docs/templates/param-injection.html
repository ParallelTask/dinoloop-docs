<h3 class="section-header">Parameter Injection</h3>
<div class="section-content">
    <p>Dinoloop team created value injection framework which automatically parses the variable segments from the URI and injects
        them to action method parameters. This reduces writing boiler plate code. This is how it works,
    </p>
    <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
        <pre [innerHTML]="paramEx"></pre>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Variable segment key should match with action method parameter.</li>
        <li>Currently, all values are injected as
            <i>string</i> type. This is the limitation of Http segments.</li>
        <li>We are excited to share in the next release V2.0, we are going to introduce
            <span class="highlight-it">@Parse</span> decorator which is capable of validating data-types of segmented-variables and http body.
