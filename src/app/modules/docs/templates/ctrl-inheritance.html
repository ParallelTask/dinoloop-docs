<div class="section-content">
    <p>Controllers can be

    <p class="sub-section-content">Inheritance (base-child controllers)</p>
    <p>Controllers can be inherited by other controllers, which allows a base-child controller relationship. If you want to
        have authorization enabled for few controllers, this is how you do it

    <ul>
        <li> Always remember, have an empty route on your base controller like this
            <span class="highlight-it">@Controller('')</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have a route on base controller such as
<<<<<<< HEAD
            <span class="highlight-it">@Controller('/base')</span> then all the child controllers have a base route like
=======
            <span class="highlight-it">@Controller('/base')</span> then all the child controllers have a prefixed route like
>>>>>>> master
            <i>/base/child1/get</i> and
            <i>/base/child2/get</i>
        </li>
    </ul>
