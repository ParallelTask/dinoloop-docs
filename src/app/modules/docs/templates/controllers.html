    This documentation assumes that you are already familiar with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> architecture. In Dinoloop, a controller is just a class. However, one must use the
    <span class="highlight-it">@Controller</span> decorator and the controller must be derived from the
    <span class="highlight-it">ApiController</span> class. Here is how you create a controller
  </p>
  <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
    <pre [innerHTML]="homeController"></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight-it">/home</span> is the prefix which allows all your routes share a common prefix.
    <a routerLink="/docs/concepts/decorators">@Controller</a> decorator has more features.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      @Controller(null) or @Controller(undefined) throws
      <a routerLink="/docs/builtin/exceptions">InvalidRouteException</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3 class="section-header">Action Methods</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    The Controller class contains methods and we can use variety of decorators (
    <a routerLink="/docs/concepts/decorators">@HttpGet</a>,
    <a routerLink="/docs/concepts/decorators">@HttpPost</a> etc) to treat them as
    <span class="highlight-it">Action methods</span>
  </p>
  <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
    <pre [innerHTML]="actionMethod"></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight-it">@HttpGet</span> creates an endpoint. Here, we have created two endpoints
    <span class="highlight-it">/home/get</span> and
    <span class="highlight-it">/home/get/user/:id</span>. For the second endpoint, values are automatically parsed from variable-segments and injected
    into parameters using
    <a routerLink="/docs/guide/param-injection">ParameterInjection</a>. Values parsed from variable-segments are always injected as a string type. However, you can use
    data conversion techniques like
    <span class="highlight-it">@Parse</span> (to be released in Version 2.x)
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      @Http*(null) or @Http*(undefined) throws
      <span class="highlight-it">InvalidRouteException</span>. * indicates Get, Post, Patch etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Now, when a GET request is made to any of these endpoints, Dinloop will return a json response with 200 status code. How
    is that possible? Generally, we distinguish two different approaches to send the response:
  </p>
  <p class="sub-section-content">1. Action method without @SendsResponse decorator</p>
  <p>
    In the example above, we haven't used
    <a routerLink="/docs/concepts/decorators">@SendsResponse</a>. So, Dinoloop keeps waiting for result from controller, once the results are returned it invokes ResponseEndMiddleware
    (a built-in dinoware) which is responsible to send JSON response. Here is the pseudo code
  </p>
  <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
    <pre [innerHTML]="responseEndMiddleware"></pre>
  </div>
  <p>If result is undefined then it ends the response with 204 status code. Otherwise, it ends the response with 200 status
    code. You can override this behavior by creating you own dinoware using
    <a routerLink="/docs/middlewares/app-middlewares">RequestEndMiddleware</a> technique.
    <!--An example to implement
    <a routerLink="/docs/examples/content-negotiation">content-negotation</a> using RequestEndMiddleware. -->
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When an action method is void or return value is undefined then it ends the response with a 204 status code.
    </li>
    <li>When the action method returns
      <span class="highlight-it">null</span> or
      <span class="highlight-it">other</span> values, It ends responds with 200 status code and result is JSON parsed.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="sub-section-content">2. Action method with @SendsResponse decorator</p>
  <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
    <pre [innerHTML]="sendsResponseUsed"></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    In the example above, we have used
    <a routerLink="/docs/concepts/decorators">@SendsResponse</a>. Dinoloop is now notified and it is the responsibility of this endpoint to send the response. Now,
    when a GET request is made to this endpoint,
    <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.download">res.download</a> ends the response.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a routerLink="/docs/concepts/api-controller">this.response</a> is derived from ApiController and it is of type
      <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res">express.Response</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      It is better practice to have return type as
      <span class="highlight-it">void</span> when an action method has @SendsResponse since the return value is ignored.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="remember-points">
    <p>
      <i class="fa fa-bullhorn" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      <span class="title">Remember</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is best practice to have every controller class name end with the word "Controller".
      </li>
      <li>
        It is best practice to have every controller class located in a controllers folder of MVC application.
      </li>
    </ul>
