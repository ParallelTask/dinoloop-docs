    Dinoloop is a REST API library for building scalable Node.js server-side applications powered by Typescript. Dinoloop uses
    <a href="https://expressjs.com">Expressjs</a> and has been designed with a simple motto to reuse similar coding skills of C#/JAVA/OOP minded programmers
    (OOP practises, SOLID principles and MVC architecture) in Node.js. Dinoloop adds syntactic sugar to expressjs enabling
    OOP programmers to easily switch to Nodejs with less learning curve.
  </p>
  <p class="sub-section-content">Typescript?</p>
  <p>
    We love Typescript and it provides great tooling to build enterprise applications.
    <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> uses typescript and now it is hard to imagine npm packages without types. If you are a lover of angular (like
    us), we highly suggest you to use Dinoloop to maintain single Typescript codebase for
    <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN</a> application.
  </p>
  <p class="sub-section-content">Why Dinoloop?</p>
  <p>
    As a contributor, we would definitely request you to give it a try (May be your personal or mini sized projects and see how
    it scales). The way expressjs does not abstract you from node.js, Dinoloop does not abstract you from expressjs (you
    have complete access to node.js and expressjs). You are free to use/mix node.js, expressjs and dinoloop codebase in your
    development. Dinoloop is a library at server-side (like
    <a href="https://reactjs.org">Reactjs</a>, we love what Reactjs does at client-side). You can either develop entire application in Dinoloop or part
    of it or gradually migrate existing expressjs to Dinoloop. The first principle of Dinoloop is to provide architecture
    shift to developers and not to create a complete bundled framework. We love and support pluggable architecture.

<h3 class="section-header">Features</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Super easy set-up, The Dinoloop team recommends your taste of starter project and start building right away. We want our
      developers to have freedom to choose DI or not. You can develop APIs without using DI framework.
      <ol>
        <li>Without DI framework
          <a href="https://github.com/ParallelTask/dinoloop-starter">dinoloop-starter-without-DI</a>
        </li>
        <li>With DI framework
          <a href="https://github.com/ParallelTask/dinoloop-inversify-starter">dinoloop-starter-with-DI</a> (uses
          <a href="https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS">Inversifyjs</a>)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Supports expressjs middlewares, completely expressjs driven library. Here is one
      <a href="#">example</a> that uses Expressjs middleware in Dinoloop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heavily influenced by MVC pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
      Configurable Dependency injection framework. You can choose your favorite DI framework
      <a href="http://inversify.io/">InversifyJs</a>,
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/peppermint-di">peppermint-di</a> and
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=DI">more</a> or build your own. Here is
      <a href="#">how you can choose your favorite DI framework</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Proper isolation of controllers and services for better unit-testing. You can use
      <a href="https://github.com/dvabuzyarov/moq.ts">moq.ts</a> (plain and less code) to create mocks in unit-tests. This is how you can
      <a href="#">create mocks using moq.ts</a> in unit-testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Controller level Middlewares, ActionFilters, ExceptionFilters, ResultFilters with Robust sync/async (handles es6 async-await
      pattern).
    </li>
    <li>
      Application level RequestStart, RequestEnd and ServerError handlers.
    </li>
    <li>
      UserIdentity principal across request. Still an experimental feature.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3 class="section-header">Philosophy</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    Dinoloop lets user to freely upgrade/downgrade expressjs.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Installing dinoloop won't install express</span>. You can install your own version of express. All you have to provide
    is express app and router instance to dinoloop.
  </p>
  <p class="sub-section-content">Why Expressjs is not bundled as dependency?</p>
  <p>
    Dinoloop is an Expressjs library with core principles to be light-weight and pluggable architecture. Libraries are built
    and targeted to work with versions, we use the same principles. Current, dinoloop version 2.x.x works with Expressjs
    >= 4.x.x version.
  </p>
</div>
<h3 class="section-header">Principles</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    Dinoloop has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much dinoloop as you need.
    Perhaps you only want to develop some "REST APIs" using dinoloop and other REST APIs can be developed using expressjs.
    In
    <a href="#">this</a> section, we will show how to create dinoloop REST API to an existing or newly created express app.
  </p>
</div>
<h3 class="section-header">Motivation</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    Typescript (Javascript now) supports object oriented programming, these features are great with SOLID design principles.
    Dinoloop has simple motto, to apply SOLID principles and reuse similar coding skills of Java and C# in Node.js. We are
    not trying to make every Node.js developer as OOP programmer, we are providing an OOP architecture framework. We love
    javascript the way it is
