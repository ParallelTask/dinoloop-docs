  <p class="sub-section-content">What is Dinoloop?</p>
  <p>
    Dinoloop is a REST API library for building scalable Node.js server-side applications powered by TypeScript. Dinoloop uses
    <a href="https://expressjs.com">Expressjs</a> and has been designed with a simple motto - to reuse similar design patterns of C#/JAVA/OOP minded programmers
    (OOP practices, SOLID principles and MVC architecture) in Node.js. Dinoloop adds syntactic sugar to Expressjs empowering
    OOP programmers to easily switch to Node.js without the steep learning curve.
  </p>
  <p class="sub-section-content">TypeScript?</p>
  <p>
    We love TypeScript because it provides great tooling to build enterprise applications.
    <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> uses TypeScript and now every npm package has types. If you love Angular (like us), we highly advise you
    to use Dinoloop to maintain a single TypeScript codebase for your
    <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN</a> application.
  </p>
  <p class="sub-section-content">Why Dinoloop?</p>
  <p>
    As a contributor, we welcome you to give it a try (for your personal or small sized projects and see how it scales). In the
    same way Expressjs does not abstract you from Node.js, Dinoloop does not abstract you from Expressjs (you have complete
    access to Node.js and Expressjs). You are free to use/mix the Node.js and Expressjs API in your development. Dinoloop
    is a library more than a framework (like
    <a href="https://reactjs.org">ReactJS</a>, we love what ReactJS does client-side). You can develop an entire application in Dinoloop, part of an application,
    or gradually migrate an existing Expressjs application to Dinoloop. The first principle of Dinoloop is to provide an
    architecture to developers and not to create a complete bundled framework. We love and support pluggable architecture.

<h3 class="section-header">Features</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Super easy set-up. The Dinoloop team provides a recommended starter project so you can start building right away. We want
      our developers to have the freedom to choose DI or not. You can develop APIs without using DI framework.
      <ol>
        <li>Without DI framework
          <a href="https://github.com/ParallelTask/dinoloop-starter">dinoloop-starter-without-DI</a>
        </li>
        <li>With DI framework
          <a href="https://github.com/ParallelTask/dinoloop-inversify-starter">dinoloop-starter-with-DI</a> (uses
          <a href="https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS">Inversifyjs</a>)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Supports Expressjs middlewares with a completely Expressjs driven library. Here is one
      <a routerLink="/docs/examples/using-Expressjs">example</a> that uses Expressjs middleware in Dinoloop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heavily influenced by MVC pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
      Configurable Dependency Injection framework. You can choose your favorite DI framework
      <a href="http://inversify.io/">InversifyJs</a>,
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/peppermint-di">peppermint-di</a> and
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=DI">more</a> or build one of your own.
      <!--Here is
      <a routerLink="/docs/examples/configure-di">how you can configure your favorite DI framework</a>. -->
    </li>
    <li>
      Proper isolation of controllers and services for better unit-testing. You can use
      <a href="https://github.com/dvabuzyarov/moq.ts">moq.ts</a> (plain with less code) to create mocks inside unit tests.
      <!--This is how you can
      <a routerLink="/docs/examples/moq-ts">create mocks using moq.ts</a> in unit-testing. -->
    </li>
    <li>
      Controller middlewares - ActionFilters, ExceptionFilters, ResultFilters with Robust sync/async (handles es6 async/await pattern).
    </li>
    <li>
      Application middlewares - RequestStart, RequestEnd and ServerError with Robust sync/async (handles es6 async/await pattern).
    </li>
    <li>
      UserIdentity principal across requests. Still an experimental feature.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3 class="section-header">Philosophy</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    Dinoloop lets users freely upgrade/downgrade Expressjs.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Installing Dinoloop won't install Express</span>. You can install your own version of Express. All you have to provide
    is the Express app and router instances to Dinoloop.
  </p>
  <p class="sub-section-content">Why Expressjs is not bundled as dependency?</p>
  <p>
    Dinoloop is an Expressjs library with the core principles centered around being a light-weight and pluggable architecture.
    We use the same principles of libraries to work with targeted versions. Dinoloop version 1.x.x works with Expressjs >=
    4.x.x version.
  </p>
</div>
<h3 class="section-header">Principles</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    Dinoloop has been designed from the start to support gradual adoption so you can use as little or as much Dinoloop as you
    need. Perhaps you only want to develop some REST APIs using Dinoloop and others with Expressjs. In
    <a routerLink="/docs/examples/using-Expressjs">this</a> section, we show how to create a Dinoloop REST API with an existing or newly created Express app.
  </p>
</div>
<h3 class="section-header">Motivation</h3>
<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    TypeScript (a superset of Javascript) supports object oriented programming (which pairs great with SOLID design principles).
    Dinoloop has simple motto - to apply SOLID principles and reuse Java and C# design patterns in Node.js. We are not trying
    to make every Node.js developer an OOP programmer, we would just like to provide an OOP architecture framework. We love
    JavaScript the way it is.
