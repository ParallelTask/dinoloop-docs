    <h5 class="section-sub-header">1. Adding dinoloop to existing expressjs application</h5>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>Dinoloop has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much dinoloop as
            you need. Perhaps you only want to develop some "REST APIs" using dinoloop and other REST APIs can be developed
            using expressjs. In this section, we will show how to create dinoloop REST API to an existing or newly created
            express app</p>
        <p class="sub-section-content">Step 1: Add HomeController (file: home.controller.ts)</p>
        <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
            <pre [innerHTML]="controllerAddEx"></pre>
        </div>
        <p class="sub-section-content">Step 2: Mount dinoloop and bind to express instance (file: app.ts)</p>
        <div class="code-snippet-terminal">
            <pre [innerHTML]="mountDinoloopEx"></pre>
        </div>
        <p>Dinoloop is mounted on
            <span class="highlight-it">/api</span> and all of its controller routes/endpoints are also mounted on
            <span class="highlight-it">/api</span>. Dinoloop will handle those requests which are mounted on
            <span class="highlight-it">/api</span> i.e.
            <span class="highlight-it">/api/home/get</span>, the other end points
            <i>/home</i> and
            <i>/about</i> which are created by expressjs are not handled by dinoloop, this way you can slowly migrate your existing
            expressjs app to dinoloop or you can start writing your new REST APIs using dinoloop in combination with expressjs.</p>
